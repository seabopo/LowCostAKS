### PROJECT GOAL
To build an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) test cluster to start studying for
some certifications. My Visual Studio Subscription comes with a $50 monthly
Azure credit, so this is the budget target for my test subscription.


### CLUSTER REQUIREMENTS
To be able to test the following:
  * A public IP.
  * A Load-Balancer.
  * An NGINX Ingress Controller.
  * Linux and Windows nodes.
  * Multiple nodes for affinity and anti-affinity testing.
  * Nodes deployed to multiple Availability Zones to test Topology Spread Constraints.
