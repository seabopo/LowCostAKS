### PROJECT GOAL
To build an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) test cluster to start studying for
some certifications. My Visual Studio Subscription comes with a $50 monthly
Azure credit, so this is the budget target for my test subscription.

### CLUSTER REQUIREMENTS
To be able to test the following:
  * Linux and Windows nodes.
  * Multiple nodes for affinity and anti-affinity testing.
  * Availability zones to test Topology Spread Constraints.
  * NGINX-INGRESS using a load balancer.
  * A public IP.
